# react-counter

This is my first time using React and I made a counter app with little to no reference to documentation or etc...

## What have I learned?
-   React
-   Making the states
-   Setting States
-   Making Class Components
-   What is super() and why must it be there

## How do I progress forward
-   Incoporate React into my webpage (at my GitHub profile), instead of using Vue, I'm doing a drastic makeover to use React.
